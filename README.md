# Satellite

Satellite is a simple project to study and play with some android components, architecture and tools
for Android development.

## Development setup

You require the latest Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2021.3.1 Patch 3 to be able to build the app.

## Tech Stack

Satellite list and detail feature uses MVVM

### Libraries

- Application entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- Asynchronous processing using [Coroutines](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/)
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) is a efficient way to handle the stream of data
  asynchronously that executes sequentially.
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)  is an observable
  data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware.
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
  refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across different pieces of content within
  your app.
- Uses [okio](https://github.com/square/okio) to make it much easier to access, store, and process
  your data.
- Uses [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for dependency injection
